# SodaSpec
A fun and easy wrapper for the SODA library.
SODA is a gorgeous UI solution for use with the iPad app Codea  
To import into Codea, copy the SodaSpecTabs file, and then hold down on the new-project plus sign on Codea's opening screen.

## Usage
- You can use this as a dependency from other Codea projects, but you will get the most out of it by directly pasting the "SodaSpec" tab into your project.
- The "Main" tab of the SodaSpec project demonstrates the creation of every UI element that SodaSpec can make. Examining the setup function should show you everything you need to know.
